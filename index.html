<h1> Hello. I'm Kim!</h1>
<h3>And this is my ceramic Journey:</h3>
<body> 
<p>  First for some background information, I have never been to a pottery studio or have ever played with clay, I always thought that I just wasn't artistic since I’ve tried other mediums like drawing and painting and I wasn’t good at either of them. When I got assigned to a ceramics class this year I thought of how difficult it would be to get an A in that class. I was nervous about trying to be on the wheel and failing to make a single piece. Luckily this wasn't the case as once I started that class I was taught about doing the techniques and once I got onto that while on my second day I made my first bowl. Although I am currently still in the ceramic class I have made a total of 8 pieces with more yet to come.
